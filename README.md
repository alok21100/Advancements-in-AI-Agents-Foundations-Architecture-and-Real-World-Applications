# 🧠 Advancements in AI Agents: Foundations, Architecture, and Real-World Applications

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of autonomous AI agents using **n8n**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **APIs**, and **databases**. Developed as part of an academic thesis, the project includes practical agents designed to automate common knowledge-work tasks.

## 🚀 AI Agents Implemented

### 🔹 1. Content Ideas Generation Agent
- Accepts user-defined input (e.g., niche, tone, format)
- Uses GPT-based LLMs to suggest original content ideas
- Results are parsed and structured for use in marketing or writing

### 🔹 2. Inventory Management Agent
- Periodically monitors inventory records via database
- Uses historical trends to highlight overstock/shortage issues
- Sends alerts or recommendations for stock optimization

### 🔹 3. Email Responder Agent
- Monitors incoming email content
- Calls GPT API to generate professional and context-aware replies
- Sends formatted emails via external email APIs

## 💡 Key Features

- Visual low-code development using **n8n workflows**
- API-driven interaction with **OpenAI GPT**, **Airtable**, and **email platforms**
- Integration with **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- Dynamic prompt engineering and result post-processing
- Modular, explainable, and scalable design

## 🧪 Usage Guide

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agents-n8n.git
   cd ai-agents-n8n

2. **Install n8n (locally or via Docker)**

   ```bash
   npm install n8n -g
   n8n start
   ```

3. **Import workflows**

   * Open n8n UI
   * Import JSON workflows provided in the `workflows/` folder

4. **Set environment variables**

   * Store your OpenAI API keys and Airtable credentials in the `n8n` credentials manager

5. **Run the agents**

   * Trigger the workflows using webhook endpoints, schedules, or manual runs
